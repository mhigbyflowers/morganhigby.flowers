<h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Web-GEMs will no longer be available to new users via POGOe after August 31, 2017. The web-GEMS modules will be moved to<a href="https://www.med-u.org/" target="_blank">Med-U</a> and will be available via subscription starting June 1, 2017.
</h3>

<p>If your institution created web-GEMs assignments before September, 2016, you are “grandfathered” into web-GEMs on Med-U and your institution will have one year free access to web-GEMs through June, 2018. (MedU has already notified users who are ‘grandfathered’ about the process). If your institution was not grandfathered in, Med-U will begin to charge a fee to use web-GEMs commencing in July, 2017.</p>

<p>Information on pricing is available through <a href="mailto:Subscriptions@med-u.org">MedU Subscriptions</a>. If you have any questions about this transition please reach out to <a href="mailto:%20eickowicz@americangeriatrics.org">Elvy Ickowicz at AGS</a>.

If you are currently using web-GEMs modules, you will have until <strong>September 30, 2017</strong> to complete the module via POGOe at no cost.</p>
